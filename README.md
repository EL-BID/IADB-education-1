See our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/8279/views/1) for `upcoming`, `in-progress` and `done` tasks.

We're using [discussions](https://github.com/github/IADB-education/discussions) to share meeting minutes and other topics that require broader communication and input.

The team from GitHub working on this project is @robcrystalornelas, @arnav-gulati and @pachicodes with the support of @csmlo

## How to run the code in this repo

The easiest way to run the code in this repo is to open up a GitHub codespace.  Here are the steps for doing so.

5) It will take some time to open, once it does, you can start running the code! Do this sequentially starting from the top to make sure all the data is loaded into your environment correctly. Start running code by either clicking the `play` button on the top of each code cell. Or use the mac shortcut `shift+enter`
